Built a Custom EC2 AMI Using EC2 Image Builder
ðŸš€ Successfully Built a Custom EC2 AMI Using EC2 Image Builder!
I recently completed a hands-on project to automate the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMI) using EC2 Image Builder in AWS. This included designing a pipeline to install Java and AWS CLI automatically, and deploy a reusable, production-ready AMI. Here's what I did:
ðŸ”§ Key Steps:
>>Created a custom Image Recipe with components to install Java 18 and AWS CLI.
>>Designed and executed an Image Pipeline that builds, validates, and distributes the AMI.
>>Built an IAM Role (role-for-Ec2-pipeline) to manage permissions securely.
>>Monitored all workflow steps (Launch, Apply Components, Output AMI) in the pipeline.
>>Successfully launched EC2 from the newly created custom AMI.
ðŸ“Œ This project showcases automation, standardization, and infrastructure-as-code capabilitiesâ€”essential for DevOps and cloud engineering workflows.
